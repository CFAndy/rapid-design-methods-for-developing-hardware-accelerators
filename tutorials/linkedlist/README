cycle_detection.c 
    
    Original software code 

cycle_detection_sw.cpp  
cycle_detection_hw.h    
    
    The SW code is partitioned based on the FPGA accelerator API. cycle_detection_hw.h is HW emulation using the original SW implementation but it is now part of the HW partition
    The idea is to reuse the cycle_detection_sw.cpp driver for SystemC TB and then as an FPGA driver

Makefile

    By default, it compiles the partitioned version of the SW (cycle_detection_sw.cpp).
